A demo personal app built with React Native. It uses Redux, redux Thunk, React Navigation 5, some must have dependecy and Kitten UI. Please

There is a protected behind authentication area where a registred user can send me a message, edit or delete his own messages. Please

There is also a push notifictaion arriving on message sent, but; I didn't implemented a database to store the push tokens. The authentication occures with Firebase Rest api and the authentication in this case does not allow to create a user object neither to loop over it and find the eventual token. I was suppose to use the Firebase auth3 app integration to do that but I started with the Rest api and for this demo purpose is ok like so.

I think the desihn is ok and it is much better than I ca do on web with CSS.

The toggle light - dark mode button at the bottom of page is pretty cool too I think.

Finished to build on 2 aprile 2020
