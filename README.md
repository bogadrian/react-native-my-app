A demo personal app built with React Native. It uses Redux, redux Thunk, React Navigation 5, some must have a dependency and Kitten UI. Please

There is a protected behind authentication area where a registered user can send me a message, edit or delete his own messages. Please

There is also a push notification arriving on the message sent, but; I didn't implement a database to store the push tokens. The authentication occurs with Firebase Rest API and the authentication, in this case, does not allow to create a user object either to loop over it and find the eventual token. I was supposed to use the Firebase auth3 app integration to do that but I started with the Rest API and for this demo, the purpose is ok like so.

I think the design is ok and it is much better than I can do on the web with CSS.

The toggle light-dark mode button at the bottom of the page is pretty cool too I think.

Finished to build on 28 April 2020
